## Run tabpy cluster via docker-compose

To run multiple instances of tabpy with nginx as load balancer run:

    docker-compose up --scale tabpy=3 -d
  

## Why this image?

Designed for kubernetes, this tabpy/docker runs preinitalized with the demo goodies. To keep things secure, it is running as 
non-privileged container, as non-root user, on busybox based Alpine. 

## Credits

I took ideas from @faizanbashir's [python datascience docker](https://github.com/faizanbashir/python-datascience/blob/master/Dockerfile) and
@erichannel's [tabpy container](https://github.com/erichannell/TabPy-docker/blob/master/Dockerfile). And most importantly, Ken Flerlage give
the idea to make this available. 

Runs on Alpine Linux 3.11 and Python 3.7.
